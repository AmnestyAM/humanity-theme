# Humanity Theme
This is the home of Amnesty International's WordPress theme, which is currently in production use on over 30 sites.  
If you'd like to use it yourself, see the [usage](#usage) section.    
If you'd like to contribute to the theme, see the [contributing](#contributing).  

## Minimum Requirements
This theme requires:     
- WordPress 5.8+
- PHP 8.2+ with the Intl extension  

## Required Plugins  
We currently rely upon CMB2 and CMB2 extensions for settings management, but our eventual goal is to remove these dependencies.  
Our full list of dependencies is below:  
- [CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2)  
- [CMB2 Attached Posts](https://github.com/CMB2/cmb2-attached-posts)  
- [CMB2 Message Field](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/cmb2-message-field)  
- [CMB2 Password Field](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/cmb2-password-field)  
- [CMB2 Sort Field](https://github.com/jonmcp/cmb2-field-order)  

## Plugin Integrations
This theme hooks into the following plugins, should they be available:
- [WordPress SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)
- [MultilingualPress](https://multilingualpress.org/)
- [Multisite Global Media](https://github.com/bueltge/multisite-global-media/)

## Companion Plugins  
Plugins which can be used to extend the theme with additional functionality, originally designed specifically for Amnesty International.  

### Donations  
The [Donations](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-donations) plugin works in conjunction with WooCommerce to provide the capability to accept one-off and recurring donations.  

### Petitions  
The [Petitions](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-petitions) plugin provides the capability to create, curate, and manage petitions.  

### Image Credit
The [Image Credit](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/image-credit) plugin adds support to the theme for automatic output of media copyright information (from the image description field) on the site frontend. The plugin uses a lookup table, which can be pre-populated using WP CLI, to make the image lookup from its URI blisteringly fast, instead of the much slower meta lookup.

### Media Copyright  
The [Media Copyright](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/media-copyright) plugin will ensure that images that do not have copyright attribution are not allowed to display on the site.  

## Usage
The quickest way to get started using the theme is to download the zip of the [latest release](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-theme/releases/latest), and install it via upload directly within WP Admin -> Themes.  
We recommend your site be configured as a [multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/create-a-network/), both for future-proofing, and for more granular user permissions control. Many of the theme's customisation options make more sense at the network-level, too.
