# Welcome to the Accessibility Contribution Guide
Here you'll find information on how to get started with contributing accessibility testing to the project.  
We endeavour to keep this project fully accessible to as many users as possible but, as we are all human, we almost certainly fall short in some ways.  

## Getting Set up
If you have developer experience, you can set up a site locally to test, by following the [developer guide](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-theme/blob/main/docs/contributors/code.md).  

Alternatively, you can set up a site with the theme by using the WordPress Playground. 
1. Download the zip file for the latest release [here](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-theme/releases/latest/download/humanity-theme.zip)  
2. Launch the [Playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/?storage=browser&php=8.2&wp=6.4&php-extension-bundle=kitchen-sink&networking=yes)  
3. Navigate to WP Admin -> Themes -> Add New Theme -> Upload Theme  
4. Upload the zip file you have just downloaded  
5. Activate the Humanity Theme  
6. Start testing :-)

For any new issues you may find relating to accessibility, please open a new [bug report](https://github.com/amnestywebsite/humanity-theme/issues/new?assignees=AmnestyAM&labels=bug,accessibility&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=Bug+-+Block+or+Feature+-+Description).
